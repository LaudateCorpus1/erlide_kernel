Erlang IDE engine supporting source code indexing and manipulation. 

Different IDEs implement clients that use this kernel to do the real work. Currently, only an Eclipse client is implemented (see the [erlide_eclipse](https://github.com/erlide/erlide_eclipse) repository).

# Important note

**The content of this repository is highly volatile at the moment**. I am working on stabilizing it (structure and release engineering) and will remove this notice when it is safe to use.

Initially, the content is the same as in the erlide repository. 

### Notes

The OTP version specified in the rebar.config files MUST be used for compilation.
