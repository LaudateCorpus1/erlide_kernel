# Important

**This repository is highly volatile at the moment**. I am working on stabilizing it (structure and release engineering) and will remove this notice when it is safe to use.

Initially, the content is the same as in the erlide repository. 

### Notes

The OTP version specified in the rebar.config files MUST be uset for compilation.
